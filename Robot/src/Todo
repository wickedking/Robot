Make the server either observer/observable to allows for method calling when updated.
Need to implement a backend database, for testing purpose
Need to implement connection to robots.

Take a step back and make sure big picture is in order, arrows are going to and from 
	correct places. 
	
NOTE:When polling the database, it is going to give back all cases to be pulled, meaning there
	will be duplicates. Either i need a new pull status number for being pulled and already polled, or
	add someway to elimitate duplicates in the server. Much faster in the database but might just be easier in
	the server for now.
